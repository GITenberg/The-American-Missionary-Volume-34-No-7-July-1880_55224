<p class="p1">We are glad that we can keep silent in regard to the closing exercises of our
schools and let others praise us; strangers, and not our own lips. Nay, better than
this, we can say that in many cases those whose praise we repeat, are no longer
strangers. In place of some of the usual reports written by our teachers, or friends
who have gone down to look into our work, having the greatest sympathy with it,
we gather up what is said by the native whites of the South, many of whom have been most
interested attendants upon all the anniversary exercises of the schools
contiguous to them. We find no fuller or more sympathetic or enthusiastic reports
in the Southern papers of the schools for whites than of ours for the colored people.
We, therefore, ask the special attention of our readers to these reports this year, as
showing the estimate the Southern press and people are putting upon our work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Dr. Rufus Anderson.</i>&mdash;Seldom have nature and grace, culture and varied discipline,
combined to form a more rounded and perfect character than that of this
sainted man, so long identified with the life of Missions, who passed to his rest
on the last Sabbath of May. He became permanently connected with the A. B.
C. F. M. in 1822, and since 1832 has largely shaped the policy of that Society.
For more than half a century, he has been in the closest sympathy with the Divine
Master in His effort to save the world, and it has often seemed to us that his face
reflected much of the sweet longings of the Master for its accomplishment.</p>

<p>It were sad to be forever on a journey, and never reach home, and so, while the
church feels a sense of loss and bereavement because of his removal from its
councils, we yet rejoice over his beautiful and useful life, and in the assurance
that to him has been administered an abundant entrance into the Kingdom of

<p><i>Deacon Isler.</i>&mdash;The Church at Wilmington, N. C., has been greatly afflicted, and
much weakened, by the death of Deacon Isler, a Christian of rare development in all
that graces Christian character. It is only five years since he came to Christ, and it

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a>

now seems to his associates that these five years have been spent under a premonition
that what he did must be done quickly. His consecration was without
reserve; nothing was too hard for him to undertake; no obstacle turned him
aside from the duty which lay before him. With no patience for those who
would accept help they did not need, he combined the purpose and constant
effort to bear in his strong arms those who did need it.</p>

<p>While, as he said, he “had his rathers,” and would like to work for others,
yet he was willingly and joyfully in the hands of Jesus. Much comforted by his
wife’s reply to his question whether she could give him up, “Yes, all I want is
Jesus,” he passed gently and sweetly away; a man of rare strength, whose death is
a great loss, but, being dead, he yet speaketh, and his works follow after him.</p>

<p>“<i>No Charge On My Books Against You.</i>”&mdash;The above sketch of a worthy and
noble man, for which we had no room in our last number, is supplemented
by an incident which must find place for brief mention.</p>

<p>When it became evident that disease was fastening upon him, the best physician
of the city was called in and put in charge of the case. He became
acquainted with the noble life of his humble patient, took the deepest interest
in him, and attended him as faithfully as if he had been a wealthy and influential
white man.</p>

<p>When one of the teachers, who had made herself responsible for the bill, called
upon the doctor for it, he said: “I have no charge against you. I only wish I
could have done more for so worthy a man; I shall be glad to give my professional
aid to as many such beneficiaries as I can.” Straws are small things, but they indicate
the <em>set</em> of the tide. Facts multiply which abundantly prove that mutually
helpful relations are being established between the two races on the basis of recognized
equal civil liberty. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ignis fatuus</i> of social equality between them
might with profit be remitted to the realm of dreams and fantasms, and wait the
establishment of such between members of the same race.</p>

<p>The <cite>Dallas</cite> (Texas) <cite>Times</cite> relates an unparalleled instance which occurred at
the last term of the Ellis Co. District Court. A negro was tried and found guilty
of conspiracy to murder. His defence had been strong but unavailing. The
judge overruled a motion for a new trial, as no error of law could be alleged and
the evidence seemed strong. When asked what he had to say, the prisoner
answered that he could say nothing which would change the sentence the court
was about to pronounce upon him, but he would like to speak a few words
to his own people in the court-room. Leave being given, he began in a slow,
quiet way to review the case. He dissected the evidence in a most masterly way,
showing its inconsistencies and contradictions; and gradually warmed up until he
burst forth into a strain of impassioned eloquence which carried audience and
court with him. When he finished, the judge said, “Sam, I thought you guilty;
I don’t believe so now, and will set aside the judgment overruling your motion
for a new trial, and give you another chance.” The attorney for the prosecution
then dismissed the case. He was an uneducated, common field hand; and yet
there are some who think the negro incapable of doing anything higher than
hoeing cotton under a white man’s supervision.</p>

<p>When Gen. Howard was in Andover, Mass., the other week, visiting his son
in Phillips Academy, he was introduced to a colored man, who asked him if he
remembered an answer given by a colored boy at the Storr’s School, in Atlanta,
some years since, to his question, “What shall I tell the people of the North?”
“O, yes,” said the General. “A little boy in a white jacket said, ‘Tell them we
are rising.’” “Well,” said the young man, “that boy has kept his promise.
He has risen and is doing noble, manly work for his people.” He has become
editor of the <cite>Journal of Progress</cite>, one of the fifty-four papers now edited by
colored men in this country.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Then and Now.</i>&mdash;Nineteen years ago, John G. Fee was waited upon by sixty-two
citizens of Bracken Co., Ky., with a peremptory demand that he should leave
the county. One of these, an influential and wealthy man, has recently called on
him and requested him to give an address on education for the benefit of an institution
which the citizens of that county have built. This building is used as an
academy. The school is flourishing, having a large number of pupils and three
teachers.</p>

<p>The door is opening wider and wider, while the number of adversaries grows
smaller: many of them deserting, and becoming co-laborers with us in this work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Savannah, Ga.</i>, has one grog-shop for each 110 of its 33,000 inhabitants, and
one Protestant church, white or black, for each 1,223; and until recently, it
is said, the churches had no particular fault to find with the grog-shops, and it
may be inferred the latter had no complaint to make of the churches. But there
has been a disturbance. Some 4,000 of the whites have enlisted to fight this
greatest curse and nuisance of our day, while the blacks are also 700 strong in the
same army. The labors of Rev. H. E. Brown, in connection with his revival work
in that city, have greatly aided Mr. Markham’s efforts in this direction; and so the
blacks and the whites are making common cause against the common enemy, just
as if their interests were identical in whatever concerns the temporal or spiritual
welfare of the city. We shall some time talk more of common interests, and
less of different colors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>Preaching, but no Instruction.</i>&mdash;In our last number, one of the missionaries in
Alabama said that many of the colored people “declare plainly they do not believe
in Bible religion.” They believe in visions and dreams. Another missionary, writing
from a section still under the spiritual guidance of the old preachers, says:</p>

<p>“These people have had preaching, but no instruction. The heart and conscience
have not been touched. The older people will come out of a religious
meeting and steal a hog for their supper. A white man said to me, ‘When these
darkies are going to have a camp-meeting barbecue, I am pretty sure to lose two
or three heads of cattle from my herd.’ One very <em>pious</em> brother, engaged in prayer
at a camp-meeting, heard some one in the crowd say, ‘Here comes a United
States marshal,’ when the brother rose from his knees, leaving his petition unfinished,
and ran with all speed for the brush.” Surely, such need truly religions
teachers.</p>

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a>

<p><i>Missionary Studies.</i>&mdash;The plan of study adopted by the church at Dorset, Vt., is
so comprehensive and practical, that we must give room to it. The reports and
papers are offered on the first Sabbath of each month, as follows: Races for
whom Christ died. 1st. Characteristics, Homes, Histories; 2d. What is being
done for their evangelization? 1. White men, Caucasian race; 2. Yellow men,
Mongolian race; 3. Black men, Ethiopian race; 4. Brown men, Malayan race;
5. Red men, American or Indian race.</p>

<p>A most valuable course of instruction is mapped out here, combining the advantages
of a literary club, with the spiritual aims of a missionary concert.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>What Does It Mean?</i>&mdash;The venerable Dr. Moffat, father-in-law of Livingstone,
says: “More has been learned regarding Africa since the Proclamation of President
Lincoln, declaring the slaves of the United States free, than in all the past.”
Who can be so blind that he does not see the relation of these two facts?</p>

<p>Today, eight European governments have from one to three exploring parties
penetrating that vast continent for various purposes. The negro slave of America
has become a free man, has the ballot in his hand, and the nation is under bonds
to fit him for citizenship. He is restive in his present position. He has an instinct
for home which does not find its full satisfaction either on the cotton lands
of Mississippi, nor on the corn fields of Kansas or Indiana. What it all means,
God in His own time will fully unfold. Meantime, the pressure of necessity is
upon us to save ourselves from being trampled to death under the feet of these
ignorant voters, led to the polls by unscrupulous demagogues. When we have
done this, we shall have fitted an instrument for God’s own right hand; whether
for use in America or in Africa chiefly, we know not, and it matters not.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>John Sykes.</i>&mdash;The editor of the <cite>Independent</cite>, on a recent excursion into Virginia,
met with, what we may begin to call, a representative negro, for John Sykes is
not so much alone today as James’ celebrated solitary horseman of thirty years
ago. He is the owner of 171 acres of land near Lake Drummond, all paid for, and
stocked with horse, mule, several cows, pigs, sheep, and fowl. He was on his
way to Hampton to hear the valedictory address of his son, with great expectations
as to what he should see and learn as to new methods of farming practiced
on the great farm connected with the school.</p>

<p>His daughter is to take her turn at the school next year, to be followed by another
son. Since he bought his land, eight years ago, twenty-five other colored
men, his neighbors, have purchased, and paid for, land in lots of from 5 to 50 acres
each, while some thirty others have contracts for similar lots. All this within eight
years, and along with it has been a progress in education and general thrift which
is most hopeful. The editor met four graduates on the same boat with Mr. Sykes,
on their way back to Hampton to attend the graduating exercises, “whose intelligence
and gentlemanliness were most marked.” He adds as the result of his observations,
what a recent excursion into the South enables us to confirm, “In Virginia,
the colored people are rapidly rising in intelligence, in comfort, and in
wealth; and the feeling of the whites toward them is quite as kindly as could be
expected.”</p>

<p>And the contrast suggested is one that it would be well for those who are impatient
of the negroes’ slow progress to follow out to the minutest detail. He
writes: “It is impossible for a visitor from the North not to compare their position

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a>

as a race with that of our ancestors two hundred years ago, when starting an American
civilization. The Southern negroes have probably as much comfort about them
as most of our early forefathers, as good houses, as good furniture, as many cattle:
but they have not the intelligent educated upper class, which founded our great
colleges and which molded our whole population. This influence they must get
from abroad. They need it, and they appreciate and want it; and no more needed
and fruitful work can be done by our benevolent people than to provide the
Southern negroes with Christian education.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The <cite>Memphis Avalanche</cite> says that a most interesting and entertaining feature
of the evening exercises, connected with the close of the Le Moyne School,
was the address to the graduating class by Judge J. O. Pierce, which was scholarly,
thoughtful and eloquent. And it adds of the school that “it is an honor to
the educational institutions of Memphis. It has done much to forward the cause
of education among the colored population, and the good results of its labors are
apparent in every direction. Institutions of this class cannot be too much encouraged.”</p>

<p>It is proof that we have entered upon a new era when the principal of one of
our schools is constrained to say, what Prof. Steele, of Le Moyne Institute, does
in a card to the editors of the <cite>Memphis Appeal</cite>:</p>

<p>“I cannot leave the city for the summer without first thanking you, and,
through the <cite>Appeal</cite>, also the other eminent gentlemen, who have, during the year
past, given us so much aid and encouragement in our work among the colored
people of this city and vicinity. The course of lectures which these gentlemen
have provided has, I am certain, accomplished much good in many ways. * * * In
this, as in every other respect, a better day is near at hand. * * * It has been our
aim, in quietly doing our work here, to hasten forward this day of better feeling,
and after years of patient toil, and amid many discouragements, we hope that at last
a day is not far distant when our work shall gain the approval and aid of all good
people, or even when we may relinquish our efforts and hand over our work to
those here who should be, and who are, I am convinced, becoming greatly interested
in it. Again, in behalf of the faculty and students of this school, and in
behalf of the American Missionary Association, which has, in the past sixteen
years, expended millions of dollars in education at the South, I thank the <cite>Appeal</cite>
and other papers and gentlemen for their interest and encouragement in our
work.”</p>

<h3>OUR GREAT NEED.</h3>

<p class="p1">We have vast opportunities. Our schools are overflowing with the best selected
material we have ever had. The fields are white for the harvest, much of which
must rot ungathered, unless a large number of laborers are sent into the field; and
these are not wanting. The day of romance in negro teaching is past, and there
is nothing in it that appeals to the mere sentimentalist. The day of danger is past,
and martyrs are not called for; but there is a demand for honest, earnest Christian
educators, who find ample field for all their best gifts, and there is no difficulty in
procuring these of the very first order. There is, also, much intelligent appreciation
of the vital importance of this work, in its relations both to the life of our

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a>

nation and the kingdom of Christ. What is needed now, and most pressingly, is
a clear apprehension on the part of churches and individuals of the relation which
their <em>gifts</em> bear to these civil and spiritual results. It is largely a question of
money given, or money withheld. “Prayers are needed?” Certainly! Prayer,
not to move the Lord so that <em>He</em> shall favor the work, and prosper the efforts of
those engaged in it, but prayer that shall shake selfish plans of expenditure which
are so large that nothing is left over for this work; prayer that shall confirm,
and give definite shape to vague desires that the means shall be provided;
prayer that selfishness may not throttle benevolence. When <em>this</em> prayer has become
fervent and effectual, the result will be <em>money</em>, which, we assert again, is
our present great need.</p>

<p>The Association was urged forward, by the zeal of the churches at the last Annual
Meeting, to enlarged plans for the year, requiring enlarged gifts from the
churches. This enlargement on our part has been made; it is necessary that
yours shall now correspond, or disaster will follow.</p>

<p>Owing to the fact that our schools close in the month of June, and our
accounts with our workers must be settled, our need is specially great at this
time. The long spell of dry weather has affected our collections in the country
churches; and there is danger that we shall suffer, as our benevolent societies do in
the presidential year, from absorption of public interest in political affairs; and so
we must urge again upon our friends the fact that our great and most pressing
need is “money.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>ARTHINGTON MISSION&mdash;THE OUTLOOK.</h3>

<p class="p1">To those who are acquainted with the fact, that there is not a single
Protestant missionary in the Nile Basin proper, from the Albert Lake to the Lybian
Desert, the subject of this article will be of profound interest. Is Ethiopia stretching
out her hands to God, or will she do so soon? For a reply to these questions,
the eye turns, just now, to this Association and the progress of the proposed
Arthington Mission. We have considered Mr. Arthington’s proffered aid, and
have sounded the call for men and means. Expectations have been raised, money
has been contributed, and the service of experienced missionaries tendered. There
have been so many disasters in connection with Central African Missions, so much
delay has been caused by unexpected obstacles, and such sacrifices of health and
life have been experienced, that we have felt constrained to proceed with the greatest
caution. The courage and faith of God’s people may be sustained for a time by
displays of enterprise, daring, and readiness to give one’s life for a good cause.
Indeed, such exhibitions are essential; but a time comes when nothing will
satisfy but solid success. Our earnest prayer from the beginning has been, that
we might be led to enter upon work in the Nile Basin, if at all, in a manner that
would give promise of great and permanent usefulness. We have, therefore,
endeavored during the past year to gather information from every available
source, and, especially, from persons who have been engaged in the service of
the Egyptian Government. In this, we have been fortunate.</p>

<p>Col. C. C. Long, of New York, who visited Mtesa’s kingdom on the Nile, has
kindly responded to our calls upon him, whenever questions of interest about
which he was informed, have arisen. More than a year ago, we submitted to him
in writing a list of thirty-nine questions for the purpose of obtaining information

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a>

on every matter of interest in connection with the Mission. To these questions, he
responded fully in writing.</p>

<p>Last autumn, Col. H. G. Prout, who had served for two years and a half on
Gordon Pasha’s staff in ancient Ethiopia, established himself in New York. At
our request, he gave us several interviews of great interest and profit. During his
stay in Central Africa, he had carefully surveyed the route from Souakim to Berber,
of which we have a full report. He had also surveyed the countries of Kordofan
and Darfur, after which, with a view to the acceptance of the governorship
of the Upper Nile Basin, he proceeded to Mrooli, by way of the White Nile and
the Albert Lake, traversing the country we propose to occupy. He kindly reviewed
with us the responses given by Colonel Long, and added valuable information.</p>

<p>Prof. Chase, on his return from Africa to London, submitted the information,
received from Col. Prout and Col. Long, to Gordon Pasha, who at that
time was in England, and from him gathered in writing additional and valuable
knowledge of the country, and the methods of procedure necessary for entering it.
Prof. Chase also obtained an interview with Dr. Felkin, of the Church Missionary
Society, who had just returned from Mtesa’s kingdom, by the way of the Nile and
Souakim. From these gentlemen, and the current literature of the year pertaining
to the Nile Basin, we are prepared to re-affirm and supplement the statements
made by us a year ago:&mdash;</p>

<p>1.&mdash;The country is accessible. Col. Prout’s survey from Souakim on the Red
Sea to Berber on the Nile, a distance of 240 miles, is reported with such fullness
of detail as to familiarize the reader with almost every mile of the journey, impressing
him with the feeling that a trip over the road at the right season would
prove a pleasurable pastime. From Berber to the mouth of the Sobat, the northern
border of the territory selected for the Mission, steamers with suitable accommodations
ply with more or less regularity. To this it may be added that abundant
supplies, except medicines, can be purchased along the route.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;The negroes from the Sobat to the Equator have not been Mohammedanized.
They are real heathen, in very needy circumstances, and would, doubtless,
welcome missionary endeavors, especially if trade and industries were promoted
in connection with religious teachings.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;The efforts of the missionaries would have a very wholesome influence upon
the Egyptian officials, and serve to check the slave-trade and to ameliorate the
condition of slaves.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;It would be the part of wisdom to locate our first stations where the people
are already protected by the Egyptian Government, as their flag would be sure
to follow if new fields were opened, and with it, temporary disturbance. Pressure
should be brought to bear upon the Khedive for obtaining permission to navigate the
Nile with steam-boats, and for freedom and protection while pursuing missionary
work at the points selected.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;While it would be desirable to commence at once, for many reasons, among
the Obbo and Latooka, south-east of Gondokoro, yet it would probably be
the part of prudence to plant our first station near the mouth of the Sobat,
where the country is rolling and well-wooded, and the people of the Nouer tribe
are friendly to missionary endeavors. From this point, there is frequent and not
difficult communication with Khartum, which is a sufficient base of supplies.

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a>

From the mouth of the Sobat, mission stations may be extended throughout the
region we hope to occupy.</p>

<p>6.&mdash;A rendezvous might wisely be established at Berber, where a fruitful oasis
affords supplies. This locality is said to be healthy, and, being situated on the
Nile in the southern portion of the desert, free from African fever. If a steamer
is secured for the Mission, the missionaries, in case of sickness or need of changes,
could easily resort to Berber, spending a portion of the more unhealthy season;
and possibly, meanwhile, developing a Mission at that point.</p>

<p>7.&mdash;The aid rendered by the Egyptian authorities to the United Presbyterian,
of America, who have established 35 mission stations in Lower Egypt, gives
promise of a good measure of protection and co-operation. Although the Mohammedans
as such, and, especially, the slave-dealers, are sure to look with disfavor
upon Protestant missions in the Nile Basin; yet, American and English influence
is sufficient to assure such toleration as is needful, while the real heathen, to whom
we hope to minister, have no political or other reasons for discouraging our
efforts.</p>

<p>From the information gained during the year, we are encouraged to believe
that as soon as the means, now being gathered in Great Britain and America,
is sufficient to warrant us in inaugurating the Arthington Mission, we can safely
and wisely enter upon the work. The amount to be made up is a little less than
$15,000. May the Lord hasten His work in His own good time.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>THE GENERIC AND THE INDIVIDUAL NEGRO.</h3>

<p class="p1">In commenting upon the evidence in the Whittaker case, one of our most fair-minded
weeklies says: “Should his guilt be finally established, the act will be a
blunder no less than a crime. Whatever his purpose, the <em>necessary</em> result of his
conduct will be injurious to ‘his people.’”</p>

<p>This is ambiguous. Whittaker is three-fourths part Caucasian, and we are
unwilling to take, as being a part of <em>his people</em>, even 1/46,000,000 part of his crime if
he is guilty, and do utterly refuse to be hurt by it. If, on the other hand, his
one-fourth part negro blood so dominates these three-fourths, that he must be accounted
a negro, then grave apprehensions are excited. That he has, as we go to
press, passed so many of his examinations successfully under all the difficulties of
his position, we must conclude is due to the modicum of negro blood in his composite
nature; a fact which foreshadows the supremacy of <em>his people</em> in our land.</p>

<p>But, seriously, we do most earnestly and decidedly protest against this
idea that the negro is not an individual but a fraction of an unit.
We believe the <em>certain</em> result will be injurious to his people, but this
will not be a <em>necessary</em> result. Were a white student guilty of such a
crime and blunder, it would be simply ridiculous to say that the <em>necessary</em>
result was injurious to “his people,” meaning the white race. There are reported
cases of self-inflicted injuries of this kind. Who believes for a moment that, because
a wife mutilates herself, as in a case reported, she has brought discredit
upon all our wives?</p>

<p>We treat Indians and Negroes in classes as if it inhered, by eternal necessity, in
the nature of things, that their individuality should be ignored, disregarded, or
trampled upon. We are a great ways off from the true and right basis of action
when we pass by the personality of any one with all his inherent rights and responsibilities,
and think of him and treat him only as belonging to a general class.</p>

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a>

<p>It may be, that until his rights are respected by the public at large, the negro must
receive special attention as the case of Whittaker has received; but, so long as his
treatment is special because he belongs to a class, it is evident that the treatment
of the class to which he belongs is all wrong. Whittaker’s innocence or guilt
pertains to himself alone, and should in no way affect the question as to the standing
or character of his people. The feeling that it must necessarily affect them is
one phase of the sentiment which has isolated and made intolerable the life of
this poor fellow at West Point. Personally he appears to be a very fine fellow,
but the condition of “his people” has necessarily&mdash;so these young cadets think,
and evidently many others who are not in the callow softness of their cadetship
agree with them&mdash;affected him, rendering him unfit for comradeship, or even decent
treatment. The questions, (any one of which is deemed a final and conclusive
estoppel to all argument as to the right of the negro to Christian courtesy),
“Would you sleep with a negro?” “Would you associate with a negro?”
“Would you marry a negro?”&mdash;these are simply absurd. Whether we would do
any, or all of these, should be answered as in the case of any person of whatever
race, in view of considerations and qualifications that are purely individual, with
no reference whatever to Ham, or to his or her people. We associate with friends
because of personal qualities, not because they are white or yellow.</p>

<p>We apprehend that in some schools for the education of colored people, the
treatment of the pupil is special because of his color. He is made to feel that he
is a special case, whatever the advantage or disadvantage of the fact, its honor
or dishonor. He is a negro, and not simply a human being. He is to stand or
fall as a part of “his people” rather than by his own individuality and personal
character. We say again, with great emphasis, that we protest against the whole
so-called necessity of the case as false and absurd; as indicative of abnormal sentiments
which must be eradicated before right results can be even sought, much
less reached.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>THE THIRD STAGE OF OUR EXPERIMENT.</h3>

<p class="p1">We have reached, and, in some of the States, have distinctly entered upon, the
third stage of our experiment of negro suffrage. In glancing at these, we shall be
simply historical, not critical; shall set down naught in malice, but with simple
truth as we have understood it. The fragments of the late Confederacy resumed
their autonomy as parts of this nation almost wholly under direction of the negro
voter. There seemed to be a double necessity that he should be armed with the
ballot, that he might defend himself against his old master who showed unmistakable
evidence of his purpose virtually to re-enslave him, and that he might
maintain the political ascendency of his friends over his master’s old friends. In
this first stage we had, as the political representative of the South, what is historically
known as the carpet-bagger&mdash;an immigrant elected by the Freedman,
hated and opposed by the native white; and legislation which burdened some of
the States to the verge of endurance was the result.</p>

<p>The second stage was reached when the influence of the general Government
was withdrawn from the South, and control passed again into the hands of the
native whites. The alien was remanded to obscurity, or found the climate of the
North more congenial, and the negro was mightily prevailed upon to forego his
right to vote. This gave us what is generally regarded as the reign of Bourbonism.

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a>

The white vote of the South became solid, and the opposition was almost
silenced. We state the fact without commenting upon it or arguing from it.
This result we might easily have inferred from what had gone before. The instinct
of self-preservation, it would seem, must have compelled such a united front
against the outrageous robbery to which the South had been subjected by ignorant
and dishonest legislators.</p>

<p>But now we have entered upon the third stage of this experiment. The solid
South is broken, not by federal assaults, or through the ambition of carpet-baggers,
but by native greed of power. The irrepressible conflict between the “ins” and
the “outs” hurls to the ground the fabric which seemed to the South so fair and
so strong. The hero of a hundred battles leads the ignorant negro to the polls,
deluded by lies and false promises, displaces one-armed Confederates who had
fought under him, to make room for a low grade of negro politicians, trails
the honor of a once proud old commonwealth in the dust, and dissipates forever
the fond delusion of a solid white South. We have had the negro placed in
authority for a brief day by federal power; then by a certain reaction driven from
the legislative hall, and in many cases from the ballot box, by the outraged white
restored to power. Now we are to see him debauched and led to the polls by
political demagogues, in a desperate and most demoralizing struggle for office.</p>

<p>Which stage has been, or promises to be the worst? Concerning this there would
doubtless be difference of opinion, according to the latitude of those who express
it. To the Southern white, nothing could seem more terrible than exposure
to the insult and burden of <em>negro</em> legislation; not simply because it is ignorant,
but chiefly because it is negro legislation. To the average citizen of the North, the
stories told of wrongs and cruelties perpetrated by the Southerners in their efforts
to deliver themselves from this, to them, intolerable degradation, have seldom
been eclipsed in horror and utter fiendishness, and nothing could be worse than
that a solid South be maintained. But to us who have been trying to grasp, in
order that we may solve, the great problem involved in the negro’s relation to our
national life, and the kingdom of our Lord, it seems evident that we are just beginning
to get a glimpse of the danger we are called to face, and with which we
must grapple. Hitherto we have chased the bear, and the chase has had its dangers;
but now the bear has turned to chase us. We can no longer calmly discuss
the question, “What shall we do with the negro?” but it becomes one of vital
interest, “What will he do with us?” We have put a bludgeon into a giant’s
hands, with which he will beat out our brains, unless we soothe and exorcise the
devil that is in him.</p>

<p>There is this one way out of our danger, and there is none other. We have
been bold enough to attempt the experiment, staking the life of our Republic
upon the issue; let us be wise enough to supply, with all promptness and fidelity,
the conditions which shall ensure its success. While the statesmanship which
thrust the problem upon us has given itself no concern whatever as to the issue,
Christian charity has shown that a blessed solution is possible. Our schools have
proved that of the ignorant slave a wise and useful citizen can be made. The
path of safety has been clearly pointed out; now let the means for achieving
this safety be supplied. We believe the nation ought to do it. We know the
patriot and Christian must do it, or this third will prove to be the final stage in
this experiment, not only of equal negro citizenship in a free Republic, but of
Republican government itself.</p>

<h3>AFRICAN NOTES.</h3>

<p class="p1">&mdash;Africa is the most profoundly interesting of missionary lands, because it is
God’s greatest providential mystery. Great in antiquity, great in its ancient
curse, great in its colossal wickedness, great in its hideous wrongs, great in its
tremendous difficulties as a mission field, great in its costly missionary sacrifices,
great in its future possibilities for Christ and the world. The eyes, the efforts,
the progress of the Church of God, must ever be more and more directed to this
grand Satansburg, as Dr. Schlier would call this great citadel of sin.&mdash;“<cite>Bible in
all Lands.</cite>”</p>

<p>&mdash;Africa is the white man’s grave; to him the sentinel of death stands five
miles out at sea; pass beyond that line and sleep on shore, and death is almost
certain. “The story of all past mission work on that Dark Continent,” says Dr.
Blyden, “is one of the saddest of our missionary stories, and three hundred
years of European intercourse with West Africa has left the people worse than it
found them.” With these facts before me, I do not hesitate to assert my honest
conviction that Africa is to be redeemed by, and through the instrumentality of,
her own sons. If we will now do our duty to bleeding Africa, and not debauch
her people with intoxicants, then we, of the Anglo-Saxon race, may yet sit as a
grand jury over that Continent, introducing all the arts of civilization, and all the
pure influences of Christianity. I am encouraged in this belief from the fact that
no tribe in the immediate rear of Liberia is considered perfect, unless it has a
man who can speak English, and this may be the language of Africa in less time
than many of us think.&mdash;<i>Edward S. Morris.</i></p>

<h4>ITEMS FROM THE FIELD.</h4>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">McLeansville, N. C.</span>&mdash;Bible temperance meetings at McLeansville, N. C.,
seem to tone up the sentiments of the people. One young man, who at considerable
trouble and expense had procured a situation in a grocery store where
whiskey is sold, has thrown up his position and gone to work on a farm, because
he was convinced that the Bible condemned liquor-selling, and he could not
ask God’s blessing upon his daily work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Charleston, S. C.</span>&mdash;Prof. S. D. Gaylord, principal of Avery Institute and
licentiate of the Central Association of Iowa, was ordained in Plymouth Church,
Charleston, S. C., by a Council convened on the 29th and 30th of May last. Several
members of the Council preached in various churches of the city, which fact indicates
a growing ministerial fellowship with our missionaries and pastors.</p>

<p>The Avery Institute for the year has numbered 476 pupils, with an average of
376&mdash;its most prosperous year.</p>

<p>The “renewal of the Church Covenant,” introduced and recommended by
Pastor Cutler, is proving a great spiritual blessing to the church, and conduces to
greater watchfulness on the part of the members.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Atlanta, Ga.</span>&mdash;On the 28th of March, the pastor of the First Congregational
Church of Atlanta proposed that the debt of that church should be paid off.
$26, from two Sunday-schools in the North, were handed in by the pastor as a
<em>starter</em>. The Professors of the University gave $30 more, and the people nobly
came forward and have now paid off all the debt, making some $563 they have
raised, aside from current expenses, since last October. They have since raised

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a>

money, which, with special gifts for that purpose, has procured a fine 800 lbs.
bell, which will greet our Secretary, when he reaches Atlanta on the 24th of June.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Marietta, Ga.</span>&mdash;A gem of a church school-house, 24×40 feet, with a gallery,
and furnished with wardrobes and Sherwood’s crown double desks, was dedicated
at Marietta, Ga., on the 6th of June. The people raised $300 for it; two
young men in Illinois gave $50, and the A. M. A. furnished the remainder, and
owns the property.</p>

<p>C. P. Jordon, a graduate of Atlanta University, takes the school; and Rev. E.
J. Penney, also a graduate of Atlanta University, and more recently of Andover
Seminary, will have charge of the church-work. Our Field Superintendent
preached the sermon. A promising enterprise, strongly manned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Mobile, Ala.</span>&mdash;The <cite>Daily News</cite>, in giving notice of the examinations at
Emerson Institute, says: “Prof. Crawford deserves great credit for the successful
manner in which he has conducted and built up this colored institution, which
today has no superior in our State.” And Miss Stevenson, of that school, from
whom we have had a pleasant call, speaks of a great change in the feelings of the
citizens of that city toward the school, its work and teachers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Florence, Ala.</span>&mdash;The <cite>Florence Gazette</cite> says of the pastor of the Colored Congregational
Church of that town: “Mr. Ash has gained the respect and goodwill
of all classes in this community, and has accomplished a most praiseworthy
educational and religious work among the people of his race.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">Chattanooga, Tenn.</span>&mdash;During the absence of the Rev. Jos. E. Smith in Africa,
a retired Presbyterian clergyman of Chattanooga, the Rev. T. H. McCallie, offered
to preach for his church three Sabbaths for three months, and to extend the time
if necessary. He took the greatest interest in the work, hunted up and looked
after the members, and, either in person or by substitute, attended the Sabbath
services and buried the dead, as if he were the pastor of the church. The Rev.
J. W. Bachman, pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of this city, also preached
one Sabbath, and has expressed the deepest interest in the church, and invited
the pastor to call on him.</p>

of faith on the first Sabbath of May.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>MAKE HASTE SLOWLY.</h3>
<p class="p1">At one of our Southern conferences
last spring, the brethren, colored and
white, were bemoaning the small numbers
and slow progress of our churches.
A Baptist minister who was present, and
who is engaged in this educational
work, turned the tide by stating that
there were advantages, for the present,
in that state of things, and that his denomination
suffered somewhat from the
embarrassment of numbers. He said
that he had been a farmer’s boy, and
that when at the tail end of a steam
threshing machine for shoving away the
straw, if for only a short time his associate
stepped away, he found himself
unable to keep up with the thresher, and
covered down by the accumulation. So
they were sometimes bothered in handling

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a>

their great numbers by way of discipline
and effort at moral elevation.</p>

<p>There is no room in the South for our
church system if its work be simply to
transfer the people in bulk from other
communions, with all their prevalent
views and practices. Our brethren of the
Baptist and Methodist churches are to be
congratulated upon their large membership,
and so upon their opportunity for
doing good. They have the responsibility
of purifying from within. Many are struggling
nobly, as exhorted by the <cite>Christian
Recorder</cite>, “to thin out the ministry of the
church until there shall not be found an
ignorant man, nor a bad man in the
ranks. Thin out the church itself.
Expel the vicious. Drive out the notoriously
bad. Have a clean church.”
Starting as a new church-life, we have
no call, no excuse for sweeping in such
material. It would be no gain to the
kingdom to effect such a transfer in
bulk. Our mission is, through our
blended educational and Christianizing
process, to help raise the standard of
Christian and church character. By the
stimulus of such example, we are doing
more to help the old churches in their
eliminating process than we could in
any other way. That same article in the
<cite>Recorder</cite>, from which I have quoted,
shows this.</p>

<p>The editor also sets down the A. M. A.
as the greatest rival of the A. M. E.,
and no doubt rejoices in this provoking
of his church to love and to good works.
But our churches, if they would attain
to much of this helpfulness, must gain
it upon the standard of intelligence and
of Christian character, without the risks
of wildness and superstition. And so,
if God be with us, if we be humble and
spiritually minded in our work, by and
by we may expect large accessions of
members. The president of a Baptist
Colored University, himself a New
England educator, remarked to me, a
while ago, that he could see that in
twenty-five years the Congregationalists
would have a large church-work among
the Freedmen, simply as the result of
their educational process.</p>

<p>Our young pastors, who have not as yet
the stimulus of the large congregations
of some other communions, must remember
that the influence of their
churches is not measured by numbers,
and that if they secure quality, this may
go further than quantity.</p>

<p>But, as it is, our church-work is not
destitute of encouragement now in regard
to numbers. Fifteen years ago
there was not a colored Congregationalist
in all the South, except in the two ancient
white Congregational churches of
Charleston, S. C., and of Liberty Co., Ga.
The system itself was utterly unknown,
as it is to this day, except where it has
crept in since the war. The experiment,
in one single locality, of swallowing
down the old-time churches, proved a
failure, and taught us a lesson. The
only gain has been by the slow process
of enlightenment and of assimilation,
mainly by the Christian-school process.
A high official in the M. E. Church said
of us: “You can afford to wait for the
youth; we cannot.” He was right.
That great Church, which is doing so
grand a work for the Freedmen, had
already on its hands hundreds of thousands
of adult members, who must be
cared for at once. By our policy of waiting,
the last Annual Report set down
sixty-seven churches, and 4,300 church
members, an average of 69 members to
each. As this is all new work, let us
compare it with new work at the West.
Alas, for the lack of church statistics
in our last Year Book! By that of the
former year, we find that the churches of
Missouri and Nebraska had an average
in each State of 27 members; Kansas
had 34; Iowa had exactly our average
of 69; and Illinois, which has been under
Home Missionary culture for sixty
years, has an average of only 25 members
more than that of the churches of this
Association.</p>

<h3>THE HAMPTON ANNIVERSARY.</h3>

<p class="center"><b>Distinguished Visitors&mdash;Speeches by Pres. Hayes,<br />
Sec. Schurz, and Others&mdash;Natural<br />
Development&mdash;Three Questions Settled.</b ></p>
<p class="smaller center">REV. ADDISON P. FOSTER.</p>

<p class="p1">The graduating exercises at the Hampton
Normal and Agricultural Institute,
on May 20, were of even unusual
interest. A large and distinguished
company was in attendance, including
Governors and other notabilities from
Massachusetts, and President Hayes and
Secretary Schurz from Washington. A
military parade by the students under
the inspection of the President, recitations,
and an exhibition of the various
industries of the school, occupied the
morning. The work of the Indian boys
excited special interest. A farm-cart,
complete in all its parts, tin-ware, tables
and large silicate globes, were
among the articles which they had made.</p>

<p>Whitin Hall was crowded in the afternoon.
The students, 300 in number,
seated on benches rising toward the rear
in front of the audience, were a picture
of neatness, intelligence and content.
Those who remembered the squalor and
ignorance of the colored people as they
sought refuge in the Union lines during
the war, could not fail to recognize the
value of the work done by the noble
educational institutions which the
American Missionary Association has
brought into existence through the
South. This thankful feeling was
deepened as the students took up
the parts assigned them. Their addresses
were not mere essays, but the
expression of their opinions on practical,
vital themes, concerning the welfare of
their race. These utterances were
marked with rare good sense, a freedom
from bitterness for past or present ill-treatment,
and a hopeful courage for the
future. More than once some expression
unexpectedly pathetic, or forgiving,
or consecrated, brought tears to the
eyes of those who heard.</p>

<p>The exercises of the students were
followed by admirable addresses from
some of the dignitaries present.
President Hayes showed how the relation
of the different races and nationalities
in the land was one of our most
vital problems, and how Hampton was
solving it. Secretary Schurz considered
at length the experiment of Indian
education, which is being tried at
Hampton, and showed why it might
succeed now when it had not in the
past. Governor Long, of Massachusetts,
referred to the presence of these educational
institutions in the South as one
of the most important results of the war.
Ex-Governor Rice, of Massachusetts, regarded
the Institution at Hampton as
the natural development of advancing
civilization, which is breaking down
the barriers of the races and bringing
all nationalities together as brethren.</p>

<p>The concurrent testimony of these
speakers, and the manifest conviction
of the visitors present, was that Hampton
is doing a grand work.</p>

<p>Its diversified departments are conducted
with such careful attention to
detail, with such consecrated, self-denying
enthusiasm, with such genius in
teaching, and with such faith in God,
on the part of its principal, Gen. Armstrong,
and his corps of teachers, gathered
from the best families of the North,
that the school could not be otherwise
than successful. This language may
seem extravagant, but, if any one is inclined
to regard it so, let him visit the
school next May, and he will appreciate
the self-restraint of one who says no
more than what has just been said.</p>

<p>The Hampton Institute has settled two
or three questions very satisfactorily.</p>

<p>From the experience of this Institution,
it is plain that it is quite possible
to combine industrial with intellectual
and religious education without injury
to any one of these branches of knowledge.
Nothing is more prominent to
a superficial observation than the industrial
side of Hampton.</p>

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a>

<p>The saw-mill, which since September
last has cut over a million feet of lumber,
the knitting-room, which has produced
this year 12,000 dozen mittens
for a Boston firm, the market-garden,
from which have been sent this spring
thirty barrels of peas a day to Baltimore,
and from which have been raised
peas and asparagus, together amounting
in value to $1,500, the ice house, in
which are stored 180 tons of ice, the
industrial room, where are made the
students’ uniforms, the cooking school,
in which the girls are taught the culinary
art, the printing office, from which
is issued monthly “The Southern
Workman,” the shoe shop, the blacksmith’s
shop, the wheelwright’s shop,
the carpenter’s shop, the repair shop,
the brick-yard, which has supplied all
the bricks used on the buildings of the
Institution, the $6,000 barn, where fine
blooded stock is kept, the farm of 330
acres&mdash;these departments of activity,
wonderful for their variety and completeness,
are steadily training the students
and the inhabitants of the surrounding
region in ways of industry.
But this is not all, nor the principal
benefit, the students receive. If we may
judge from a hasty inspection of classes,
from the scope and skillful expression
of thought in the graduating exercises,
and from the testimony of teachers, a
thorough and sufficiently extended education
in all mental departments is given.
Best of all, as the crown no less
than the beginning of wisdom, the students,
entering the school without special
religious impressions, seldom leave it
without becoming devoted Christians.
The result of the combination of industrial
with other forms of training, is
seen in the evident union in Hampton
students of hard good sense with scholarly
intelligence and unostentatious
piety.</p>

<p>Another question is most satisfactorily
settled, whether it is possible to
educate the Negro and the Indian together.
On graduation day, in sight of
the audience, was a stand on which rested
a fragment from the building recently
burned. It was a mass of red and
black bricks cemented together, and
prettily draped with vines. If this was
designed to be emblematic, it was
truthfully so. The red and the black
races do harmonize most happily at
Hampton, and cultivate together the
graces of character. They are a mutual
help to each other, especially the Negro,
as farther advanced in civilization, to
the Indian. Their dispositions supplement
each other. The Negro is enthusiastic,
demonstrative and dependent,
the Indian reserved, bashful and
self-contained. Each finds in the other,
qualities that he needs and that attract
him. As a consequence, there is great
friendliness between the two races.
When the colored boys were asked if
any of their number were willing to
room with the Indians, that the latter
might learn to speak English more
readily, there was no lack of volunteers.
And no one can doubt the kindly feeling
pervading the school, who has seen,
as we have, Indian and Negro boys
walking together, or chatting on the
green with arms lovingly about each
others’ necks.</p>

<p>Other questions, such as the wisdom
of educating the Indians away from
their tribes, or of the coeducation of the
sexes, we have no time to discuss. It
is sufficient to say that the experience
of Hampton is thus far entirely satisfactory
in these regards.</p>

<h3>FISK UNIVERSITY.<br />
<span class="standard">Examinations&mdash;Ode to Jubilee Bell&mdash;Dr. Willcox’
Address&mdash;Prosperous Year.</span></h3>

<p>The Nashville <cite>Daily American</cite>, whose
proprietor is the Honorable Secretary of
the U. S. Senate, gives a full report of
all the commencement exercises of this
school, from the Sabbath morning sermon
by Prof. Bennett, the baccalaureate
by Pres. Cravath in the afternoon, and

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a>

the missionary sermon by Dr. Twichell,
of Cleveland, Ohio, in the evening, to
the doxology with which the Alumni
dinner closed on Thursday afternoon,
making in all at least five full columns.</p>

<p>Monday was given to examinations.
The <cite>American</cite> says: “These examinations
were held in different recitation-rooms
of Jubilee Hall and were attended
by interested visitors.</p>

<p>“We stopped a while in the room
where the Senior Class was being examined
in Geology by Prof. Chase. One
student was giving the names of sixty
or seventy specimens of minerals, ores,
rocks and fossils. Another was determining
the nature of certain minerals by
means of the blow-pipe, while another
gave the classification of the mineral
kingdom as he had written it on the
board. Prof. Morgan was hearing a class
in Cicero as we entered the library, and
one of the students was reading in a
sonorous tone the impeachment of Cataline
by Cicero.</p>

<p>“In another room, Prof. Spence was
hearing a class in Phædon. Prof. Bennett
conducted a class through the
United States History within the hour
and a half allotted to him. Other
classes were examined in Astronomy,
Virgil, and the Greek Testament. In
Normal School, under the care of Miss H.
Matson, assisted by Misses E. M. Barnes
and S. M. Stevens, classes were examined
in Arithmetic, Grammar, Physical Geography,
and Reading. A person passing
from one room to another would be impressed
with the thought that hard and
conscientious work had been done, and
that the examinations were impartially
conducted in order to draw out the exact
knowledge of the pupil upon the
subject under consideration.</p>

<p>“In the evening came the Common
School Normal Exhibition, beginning
promptly at 8.30 o’clock. The beautiful
song, “The Morning Freshly Breaking,”
was sung by a well-trained chorus.
The music of the entire week, consisting
of thirty pieces or more, was under the
charge of Miss Mary O. Swift, who combines
with great ability as an instructor,
a voice of rare sweetness and power.</p>

<p>“Those who took part in this exhibition
had finished the normal course,
which is adapted to the demands of the
State schools, and received a certificate
in which their standing in the studies of
the Common School Normal Course is
given. Most of these will continue to
pursue their studies further. The examination
of the day, together with the
exercises of the exhibition, promise well
for the remainder of commencement
week.</p>

<p>“On Tuesday, examinations were continued.
We spent a good deal of time in
the Model School, an important attachment
of the Normal Department of the
University. The presiding genius of this
school is Miss Irene Gilbert, a lady who
seems to have been born for the position
she holds in the Model School.</p>

<p>“She has had upwards of a hundred
children from the city under her charge
during the past year, and has carried
them forward with an unflagging enthusiasm,
which has secured the best results.
The Normal Class, which received
certificates on Monday night, have paid
daily visits to her school to witness
the drill which she gives her juveniles
in the mysteries of reading, spelling,
and rudimentary mathematics. Details
of students from the Normal School
have been made daily, who instructed
the Model School pupils, under
the critical eye of Miss Gilbert. When
it is remembered that Fisk University
contributes one hundred and fifty
teachers to the schools of the South,
it will be seen that the drill thus
received is especially valuable to those
who receive it.</p>

<p>“In the evening came the Union
Literary Society Exhibition.</p>

<p>“Wednesday afternoon, at 3 o’clock,
occurred the presentation of the great
Bell given to the University by the Jubilee

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a>

Singers and Mrs. Gen. C. B. Fisk, of
New York. These were of an exceedingly
interesting character. Speeches were
made by Prof. White and Mr. Loudin,
on the part of the singers, and by Pres.
Cravath, Prof. Willcox, and others;
after which a poem by Prof. Spence
of the University was read. A number
of pieces were sung by the Jubilee
Singers, who furnished much of the
music for all the exercises.</p>

<p class="center">“The evening was given to the<br />
SENIOR PREPARATORY EXHIBITION.</p>

<p>The programme was a full one, and
well carried out.</p>

<p>“In some respects the Senior Preparatory
Exhibition of Fisk University is <em>the</em>
night occasion of commencement week.
The interest rises from the first, and culminates
with Wednesday night. This
was specially true of this year. The
knowledge of the fact that the Jubilee
Singers were to sing contributed to
crowd the chapel with such an audience
as has not been assembled in it for
months. Every inch of available space
was occupied, and many were compelled
to stand at the entrance unable to find
seats. The Jubilee Singers opened the
exercises by a song, “Sweet Music”&mdash;Beethoven.</p>

<p class="center">“Thursday, commencement proper:<br />
CLOSE OF THE MOST PROSPEROUS YEAR<br />
IN THE HISTORY OF THE INSTITUTION.<br />
</p>

<p>“According to announcement, the
commencement exercises took place
Thursday morning at 10 o’clock, in the
presence of a crowded house. In addition
to the decorations of the previous
day, the wall back of the platform was
tastefully set off with the folds of the
Dutch and English flags, the American
flag being on duty on the border. Upon
the folds of the flags were arranged in
letters of cedar the words, ‘The Class
of 1880.’ Six young men then gave their
graduating addresses. These are kindly
and appreciatively spoken of, as able
and well delivered.</p>

<p>“Prof. G. B. Willcox, D. D., of Chicago,
was introduced and spoke to the
graduates in reference to those things
which scholars hold in common. The
ideal of a college graduate is that he has
come to the possession of his manhood.
It is impossible to give the spirit of
this most able address. It abounded in
wit, humor, and pathos. These kept
the audience on the alert for an hour,
after they had sat two hours during the
previous exercises.</p>

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a>

<p>“Then came, what is now a feature
of Fisk commencement day, the Alumni
dinner, with its post-prandial wit and
wisdom. And thus closed the most successful
and prosperous year in the history
of Fisk University. The catalogue
shows an aggregate of 350 students.
The work done in the class-room has
been unusually satisfactory. There have
been abundant evidences of growth in
character and mind on the part of all
the students.”</p>

<h3>STRAIGHT UNIVERSITY.<br />
<span class="standard">Why No Graduating Class&mdash;Threatened Suspension
of Public Schools.</span></h3>

<p class="smaller center">REV. W. S. ALEXANDER, NEW ORLEANS.</p>

<p class="p1">The anniversary of Straight University
was observed at Central Church. The
audience, both in numbers and intelligent
appreciation, was one of the best
ever gathered for such a purpose in the
city. The literary exercises were exceptionally
fine. The original orations, one
on “Charles Sumner” and the other on
“Our Glorious Union,” were, both in
composition and delivery, worthy of high
praise. All who heard them were proud
of the young and promising orators. A
cultivated lady in the audience said to
me, at the close of the evening, “You
don’t tell me that those orations were
written by the young men?” “Certainly;
why not?” “Why,” she replied, “I
have never heard better.”</p>

<p>There was no graduating class this
year. Those who in order would this
year have finished their course, were persuaded
to remain another year that their
graduation might signify a higher grade
of scholarship.</p>

<p>The year has been crowned with the
Divine favor. Three hundred students
have been in attendance, real progress
has been made in all departments of
study, and the Institution stands higher
today in the estimation and affection of
the New Orleans public than in any previous
year.</p>

<p>Unless all signs fail, the ensuing year
will bring to our doors a greatly increased
throng of eager and earnest students.
The public schools of New Orleans,
and of Louisiana, are threatened
with the evils of indefinite suspension.
The doors will be closed June 30th, and
the wisest friends of education cannot
predict the time of their re-opening.</p>

<p>So far as adequate support is concerned,
the public school system in this
State has been an uncertain quantity for
many months. Its fate trembles in the
balance today. A subscription list is
now in circulation among the merchants
and bankers to raise money to pay the
public school teachers the monthly salaries
long since due. The most plaintive
appeals are made to public sympathy in
their behalf. It is a time to press forward
our work.</p>

<p>Applicable to the impoverished State
of Louisiana, so far as her public schools
are concerned, are the words: “The
fields are white already to the harvest,”
and “The laborers are few.”</p>

<h3>TOUGALOO UNIVERSITY.<br />
<span class="standard">More than a Thousand Visitors.<br />Promise of
the Coming Year.</span></h3>

<p class="p1">The commencement exercises of this
growing and popular University were
held on Thursday, June 3d, and drew
together an unusually large company of
visitors within its wide grove of moss-draped
oaks.</p>

<p>Many parents were present on this
day, and also at the annual examinations,
which continued from Monday till
Wednesday evening. Two old men
came from the northeastern corner of
the State, a distance of 200 miles or
more, to see their sons graduate.</p>

<p>The pains and thoroughness with
which the examinations were conducted,
aiming to exhibit the pupil’s real knowledge
of his studies, the evidence
throughout all of great care and constant
drill in the use of clear, simple

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a>

and correct English, and the plain indication
of independence on the part
of the students in their studying and in
their own thinking, made these class
exercises of unusual interest. The
Senior Class passed creditable examinations
in Natural History, Science of Government,
The Theory and Practice of
Teaching, and Natural Philosophy.
There followed on Wednesday evening
the exhibition of the Primary and Intermediate
Departments, combined with
that of the strong Temperance Society&mdash;an
organization extending through the
whole school, and representing a work
of great importance yet to be done in
this State, where nearly all people are
in the habit of drinking, and that to excess.</p>

<p>On Thursday, a class of seven young
men presented orations, and received
certificates of graduation from the Normal
Department of the Institution.
These orations were highly commended
by the prominent gentlemen who were
present from Jackson. In the afternoon,
a stirring address was delivered by President
De Forest, of Talladega College,
upon the topic of “Work.” This was
followed by speeches from Capt. Wolf,
of Jackson, from Dr. Watkins, the venerable
pastor of the Methodist Church
at Jackson, and from Dr. Hunter, pastor
of the Presbyterian Church of the same
city, all of whom expressed appreciation
of the good work this Institution is
doing. More than a thousand visitors
were present at these closing exercises
on Thursday, an excursion train running
from a point fifty miles distant for their
accommodation. The location of the
University on this great railroad which
passes north and south through the centre
of the State, these beautiful groves
being only about half a mile from the
depot, furnishes rare facility for such a
gathering of the friends and patrons of
the school. The ignorance among the
people in this State is fearful, but it is
a very hopeful sign when the colored
people are themselves showing an interest
in such a school as this one now is,
and when they are beginning to appreciate
the sort of training given here to
their young men and women. Much of
this has been brought about through the
wise, energetic and progressive management
of the President, Rev. G. S. Pope.</p>

<p>The promise for the coming year is
flattering. The school will probably be
crowded even more than during the year
just past. The buildings must be in
some way enlarged, or new ones provided,
in order to have room for all who will
doubtless desire to come. There has
been little or no complaining by the
students on account of very rough, cold
and crowded rooms&mdash;the only temporary
places which hitherto could be provided.
Another year, however, ought to bring
better accommodations. Here is a place
second to none in our country for
the doing of great and far-reaching good.</p>

<h3>HOWARD UNIVERSITY.<br />
<span class="standard">Theological Department&mdash;Sixteen Graduates.</span></h3>

<p class="smaller center">REV. W. W. PATTON, D. D., WASHINGTON</p>

<p class="p1">The anniversary exercises of the Theological
Department of Howard University,
(which is largely aided by the American
Missionary Association), occurred on
the 7th inst., in Washington. The spacious
and beautiful edifice of the New
York Avenue Presbyterian Church was
freely offered for the purpose, and was
filled with a large audience of white
and colored people. Such an event
could not have taken place at any
former time, and it marks the rapid
and healthful progress of public opinion.
Six of the graduating class made
addresses, which were a credit to themselves
and to their race, and elicited the
commendation of many intelligent gentlemen
and ladies who heard them. Sixteen
students were sent forth to preach,
all of whom go to the South, to the
Freedmen. Five of these had pursued
a full course of study, including Hebrew

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a>

and Greek: the others had received
training in English studies only. Fifty
theological students have been under
instruction in this department the present
year. Each graduate received a
handsome Bible from the Washington
Bible Society, and an address was delivered
by Rev. W. R. Harrison, D. D.,
chaplain of the House of Representatives,
and pastor of the South Methodist
Church in this city&mdash;a fact which
marks the progress of good feeling.
Never before was the promise of usefulness
in this work so great.</p>

<h3>LEWIS HIGH SCHOOL.</h3>

<p class="center">(<cite>From the Macon, Ga., Telegraph and Messenger.</cite>)</p>

<p class="p1">As announced, the closing exercises
of the Lewis High School took place
yesterday, May 27th, and reflected
credit alike upon teachers and pupils.
The latter, embracing both sexes, number
110; and a more intelligent and
well-behaved body of colored youth
cannot be found anywhere. The singing
and music were especially good, indicating
great aptitude on the part of
the scholars, and very careful training.
This Institution is under the care of the
American Missionary Association, whose
headquarters are at New York. It appoints
the teachers, and supplies all the
funds that may be needed annually for
its support.</p>

<p>The school is under the general supervision
of the pastor of the Colored Congregational
Church, Rev. Mr. Lathrop,
who also teaches chemistry, philosophy
and book-keeping. In all of these
branches, the pupils exhibited commendable
proficiency.</p>

<p>Among those who attended the examinations
were Rev. Geo. McDonald, D. D.,
and Rev. Joseph Key, D. D. Both of
these gentlemen expressed themselves
highly gratified with all that they saw
and heard, and when called upon, responded
with neat and appropriate
addresses, to the great encouragement and
delight of their auditors.</p>

<p>The Lewis High School, under the
judicious management of Mr. Lathrop,
Miss Christine H. Gilbert, principal,
and her efficient assistant, Miss Belle M.
Haskins, is doing a good work for the
colored people of Macon, and should receive
the countenance and support of
our citizens.</p>

<p>The college building is a neat brick
structure, which was erected at a cost of
$5,000 upon the site of the edifice which
was destroyed by fire. The school will
open again on the first of October next.</p>

<h4>BEACH INSTITUTE.</h4>

<p class="center">(<cite>From the Savannah Morning News.</cite>)</p>

<p class="p1">The scholastic year of the Beach Institute,
which closed yesterday, was made
the occasion of interesting school
exercises in the examination of the several
classes of the Institute, and an exhibition
of the scholars in recitation, declamation,
reading and singing.</p>

<p>The Beach Institute is one of the educational
institutions under the control
of the American Missionary Association,
whose headquarters are at New York, and
whose operations in the South have been
directed to the moral and educational
advancement of the colored people. The
Southern work is under the superintendence
of Dr. J. E. Roy, whose headquarters
are at Atlanta, and who was
present yesterday, a gratified spectator
of the progress made at the Institute
in the education of the colored race.</p>

<p>The school here is, as we learn from
the Superintendent, Prof. J. K. Cole,
in a prosperous condition, nearly 300
scholars having been registered during
the scholastic year.</p>

<p>The Institution is divided into five
grades, under competent teachers, as
follows: The first grade, or normal class,
under Professor Cole, the Superintendent;
the second grade, Miss Partridge,
teacher: the third grade. Miss Bailey,
teacher; the fourth grade, Miss Burgh,
teacher; and the fifth grade, under the
supervision of Miss Willey.</p>

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a>

<p>The examination yesterday evinced
the faithfulness of the instructors in
their departments and the aptitude of
the pupils, and we were particularly
struck with the examination of the
normal class in introductory Latin exercises,
the pupils showing a remarkable
proficiency in their recitations from
Harkness’ Introductory Latin Lessons.</p>

<p>At 12 o’clock, the whole school assembled
in the chapel, when the programme
was successfully carried out,
to the pleasure of the large number of
friends and parents of the pupils present.</p>

<p>The school will re-open on the first
Monday in October.</p>

<h2>AFRICA.</h2>
<hr class="chap" />

<h3>SUNDAY-SCHOOLS IN CENTRAL AFRICA.<br />
<span class="smaller">A Paper read at the State Sunday-school Convention, at New Britain, Ct., May 26, 1880,
by Albert Burton Jowett a native of the Mendi Country, West Africa.</span></h3>

<hr class="quarter" />

<p>I represent the Sunday-schools in the
Mendi country of Western Africa. These
are located in the interior, about a hundred
and fifty miles north of Monrovia,
the capital of Liberia. The first Sunday-school
among the Mendi was established
at Kaw Mendi. This place was the site
selected for a mission by Messrs. Raymond
and Steele, who accompanied the
Amistad captives to Africa, when they
left Farmington in 1841.</p>

<p>At this school, my mother was a pupil,
and had for her instructor, Mar-groo, one
of the Amistad captives who had been
hopefully converted.</p>

<p>There was a good day-school at this
place, and also one at Freetown, a hundred
and fifty miles north, which had
been kept up for twenty-five years by
the Church Missionary Society of England.</p>

<p>My mother has often told me that the
missionaries were very much pleased because
the Mendi boys passed a better
examination than the boys at Freetown,
who had had all the advantages of that
sea-port city.</p>

<p>Mr. Burton, a missionary who went
to Africa from Connecticut, while traveling
up the Bar-groo river noticed a fall
of water in a wooded country, and determined
to establish an industrial mission
at that point.</p>

<p>There was no saw-mill on the coast,
so Mr. Burton put up buildings for a
mill; some one gave him the necessary
machinery, and he opened a station and
named it “Avery.” A church and
some dwelling houses were built, and a
community of people gathered who
bought logs, converted them into lumber,
and conveyed it to the coast for sale.
A school was opened in the basement of
the church, and a Sunday-school was
convened on Sundays. My father is a
teacher and interpreter at this station.
This Sunday-school and the one at Kaw
Mendi are the only ones in the Mendi
country proper, where there are about
2,000,000 people. There are Sunday-schools
on the Sherbro Island, but the
people there belong mostly to the Sherbro
tribe.</p>

<p>Our Sunday-schools constitute one of
the means by which our young African
friends acquire the simple truths taught
by our blessed Saviour. I do not know
how it is, if I am in the wrong, pardon
me, but I do believe it is much more
difficult to teach in Africa than in America,
because we have no books in the
Mendi language and the children know
but little English. Our Sunday-schools
in comparison with those in America
are very small. The bell for school
rings at 2 o’clock, and the teachers go
round to the houses where they fear the
children do not care to come, and bring

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a>

them to the school. Before bringing
them in to the Sunday-school, a shirt is
given to each scholar, as many of them
wear no garments at home. This is
made of English cloth and supplied by
the missionaries; when they return from
school, it is laid aside to be worn the
next time the school assembles. The
instruction is mostly oral&mdash;the teacher
asking the pupils questions and then requiring
them to repeat the answer until
they are able to say it.</p>

<p>A good deal of time is spent in singing,
as the children readily learn the
words and music of the Gospel songs,
even though they do not understand the
meaning of the English words. They
are very fond of singing indeed, and the
missionaries listen to their songs with
much delight, and give them a great
deal of credit for them. As some of the
children never attend day-school, the
alphabet is taught in the Sunday-school.</p>

<p>We have a portion of the Bible, and a
few hymns, translated into the Mendi,
and hope some time to have books in the
language, so that greater progress can
be made.</p>

<p>We have some active members who
go about into the small villages and act
as home missionaries among the people.
These frequently bring in new scholars
to the mission: and what do you think
causes the increase of our members,
more than most any other circumstance?
Some kind friends in America and England
have been sending us illustrated
papers, nice little books, and small cards
with letters of nearly every color and size.</p>

<p>Such things are very attractive to the
little natives. I wish you could know
the good you can do, by sending your
missionaries in Africa such attractive
papers and cards, for those whom the
missionaries cannot reach will be instructed
and influenced by them in their
homes. The children who are brought
in, take these papers and fasten them up
in their houses for ornaments. The
books and cards are offered as prizes to
those who commit portions of the Scripture
accurately.</p>

<p>We have no Sunday-school Conventions
like this one, but sometimes we
have Concerts.</p>

<p>Within the past few years, all our
missionaries have been Freedmen from
America, and one of them was for a
time connected with the Jubilee Singers
of Fisk University. They taught us some
of the Jubilee Songs, such as “Steal
Away to Jesus,” “Mary and Martha,”
and “The Hocks and the Mountains
Shall All Flee Away.” The people had
never heard the like, and were very much
delighted with them.</p>

<h2>THE INDIANS.</h2>
<hr class="chap" />

<h3>S’KOKOMISH, WASHINGTON TERRITORY.</h3>

<p class="center">REV. MYRON EELLS.</p>

<p class="p1">On the first Sabbath in April, we had
the privilege of receiving three more into
our church, all on profession of faith,
two of them Indians from the school,
and the other a young lady who has
been assistant-matron in the boarding
department. The Twanas and Clallams
were formerly at war with each other,
and even now there is not always the
best of feeling between the two tribes:
a like unpleasant feeling has often been
shown between the whites and Indians:
yet, on that Sabbath, representatives
of the three classes received baptism,
there being one Twana, one Clallam,
and one white person.</p>

<p>Another noticeable fact was the motive
which induced them to become
Christians. In reply to my question on
this point, each one unknown to the

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a>

other said, that it was because he had
noticed that Christians were so much
happier than other people. Two of
them had tried the wrong road very
earnestly, and had found to their great
sorrow that “the way of the transgressor
is hard.” I was led then to think
of two or three others who had united
with the church on profession of faith
within about a year, employees on the
Reservation, who had made similar statements.
“If the Bible were not true,
and yet I could only believe it to be true,
I would gladly do so, if it would bring
me the happiness that Christians profess
to have,” said one. Since becoming a
Christian, he has often spoken of his
happiness, and has great pity for those
who are skeptical, for he knows how
they feel, even if they do argue against
Christianity. Another of the number,
who was for three years very skeptical,
a talented writer, and who used her talents
against Christianity so strongly
that her companions feared to enter the
lists against her, and who was supposed
to be thoroughly contented in her unbelief,
became a Christian, and now
speaks of those years, as “three years
of horrible darkness.”</p>

<p>On the third Sabbath of April, I was
at Dunginess, where I received four more
into our church, three on profession of
faith. Two Indians and two whites
stood side by side to enter the church.
The communion season was very pleasant.
One white lady, who had not been to the
Lord’s table for a year, and who was
just recovering from sickness, was so
anxious to be present, that as she
was unable to walk the distance, a little
more than a quarter of a mile, she was
carried by her husband more than half
the way in a wheelbarrow. Another
lady, seventy-six years old, walked three
miles to be present, then another mile
to where I should preach to the whites
in the afternoon, and home again in the
evening, about eight miles in all. Ten
of the whites sat down there with the
four Indians in the Indian church to
celebrate Christ’s love.</p>

<p>One person, who lives half a mile
from the Indian village, said to me, as
we came away, “It is a shame, <em>it is a
shame</em>, that the Indians here are going
ahead of the whites in religious affairs.
It is a wonder how they are making advancement,
considering the examples
around them.” Two marriages, one infant
and three adult baptisms, four received
to the church, one communion
service, one funeral, three prayer-meetings,
and other services to the amount
of fourteen in all, were the result of the
eighteen days I was away from home.</p>

<p>I had been at home but a few days
when I was sent for by an Indian on the
Reservation who has been an invalid for
some time, and who asked to be received
as a member of the church. After considerable
consultation, he was so received
week ago last Sabbath.</p>

<p>Last Sabbath, my work at Seabeck culminated
in a small church organization
among the whites. I have written you
that I have preached at that place, thirty
miles distant, about once a month, when
not called on some distant trip. The
work has amounted to about eight visits
a year.</p>

<p>Some six weeks ago, I felt that it
was best for the few Christians there to
be banded together. I immediately
tried to obtain some assistance in organizing,
but after three efforts failed entirely,
and hence, armed with authority
from this church, I proceeded with the
organization. Nine entered it, two on
profession of faith. The heterogeneousness
of the population may be seen from
the fact that of the seven who joined
from other churches, one came from a
Congregational church and two from a
Protestant Methodist church in this Territory,
one from a Congregational church
in California, one from a Presbyterian
church in British Columbia, one from
the Episcopal church in England, and
one from the Lutheran church in Norway,

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a>

who, however, does not believe
that he was a Christian until after he
left Norway. “It is the Lord’s doings
and it is marvellous in our eyes.”</p>

<p>In the civilization of the Indians we
feel somewhat encouraged. One fact
has appeared quite plainly during the
past winter. It has been the most severe
winter known here for twenty-five
years&mdash;the snow at one time lying five
feet deep&mdash;and although it was nearly
gone on the tide flats in six weeks, yet on
most of the Reservation it lay for more
than three months from six inches to two
feet deep. As late as four or five years
ago, the Indians generally lost a large
number of cattle or horses every winter
for want of feed, even when there were
only two or three weeks of snow, selling
altogether too much of their hay in
the fall; but during the past winter not
one of their animals has died for want
of food, as far as I have been able to
learn. Experience and observation have
taught them to secure sufficient food
and to keep it until all danger is over.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">OUR WORK AT THE CENTER.</h3>

<p class="center">REV. W. C. POND, SAN FRANCISCO.</p>

<p class="p1">I find that for many months I have
had little to say about our work in San
Francisco and Oakland. I invite the
readers of the Missionary to take a look,
with me, at these central points.</p>

<p>Oakland is more to San Francisco,
than Brooklyn is to New York. The
ocean breezes are so tempered in crossing
San Francisco Bay, that a very perceptible
change of climate takes place,
and Oakland is able to boast of a genial
air and a clear sky on many days in
summer, when San Francisco is shrouded
in fog or swept by heavy, dust-laden
winds. It has the aspect, to a very good
degree, of a large inland city in New
England&mdash;Springfield or Hartford, for
example. There is a good deal about it
not yet very heavenly, but, when compared
with the bustle and drive of affairs,
both climatic and human, on this side
of the Bay, it seems, like Auburndale,
Mass., to be a sort of “Saint’s rest.” It
is constantly skimming the cream off our
San Francisco churches, so that when a
brother and sister have fairly come to
their places as pillars here in the metropolis,
we expect soon to hear that “they
are thinking of moving to Oakland.”</p>

<p>These considerations have led to a
more abundant provision for missionary
work among the Chinese in that city,
than anywhere else. Persons, coming to
California to labor in this missionary
work, are quite apt to become impressed
with the necessities of the <em>Oakland</em>
Chinese. And so, if our mission had
not been, by many years, the first in that
field; and if there had not gathered
about it a large number of Christian
Chinese for whom it is a spiritual home;
and, if it were not possible&mdash;thanks to
the generous provision made for us by
the First Congregational Church&mdash;to do
more work there now, in proportion to
expense, than almost anywhere else, I
should feel like abandoning the field to
those who have crowded in to help us.

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a>

In the new, spacious and elegant church
edifice, rooms much more commodious
and much better furnished than those
of any other school, have been prepared
and assigned to our Chinese work.
On the Sabbath, they are occupied by
the Chinese Sunday-school, superintended
so many years by our dear brother,
the late Dea. Edmund P. Sanford, and
now in charge of one like-minded, A.
L. Van Blarcom, Esq. On week-day
evenings, they are opened for our mission
school, at which about the same
pupils gather who are present on the
Sabbath, and every session of which is,
in large part, a religious service. About
eighty Chinese account themselves members
of this school, attend it when they
can, and are under its gospel influence;
but there are so many interruptions
through the pressure of their daily work,
that the average attendance is about
thirty. Two teachers are employed,
Mrs. B. C. Hawes and Miss L. Duncan,
who, by years of service in this field,
have won a warm place in the affection
and respect of the Chinese. The expense
is $40 per month. As fruits
of this labor, we have 17 who are members
of the First Congregational Church
in Oakland, nearly as many more in
other churches, and a goodly number
who have professed Christ in the Association,
but have not yet been baptized.</p>

<p>In San Francisco there are 4 schools;
Central, Barnes, Bethany, and West.
The Central school is taught in our Central
Mission house, the headquarters of
our work for the whole State. This is,
I regret to say, a <em>rented</em> building, the
cost of which absorbs more than a sixth
of the utmost amount we can hope to
command for our whole work. We have
occupied it now almost six years, have
spent in rents nearly enough to have
paid for as good a building, if only we
could have seized our opportunity; and
I cannot even yet get sufficiently hardened
to this expenditure, to meet it without
a throbbing heart. “If only I could use
this sum for teaching and preaching the
Gospel of Christ!” is my thought and
my longing; when will the time come?
The building is a very plain one, but
pleasantly located, just on the edge of
the Chinese quarter, and overlooking an
acre or two of greenness in the heart of
our city which we call “the Plaza.”
It has two stories and a basement, the
latter occupied by our Association of
Christian Chinese as a hall and reading
room, with some facilities in the rear for
hospitality. The first floor is the school
room (18 x 50), in which at times no less
than 145 Chinese have crowded themselves.
The average attendance now is
about 60; it is increasing, and I hope
will again reach 100. In the upper story
are the rooms of our Chinese helpers,
with a little office, also, for the Secretary
of the Association above named. A
great deal of work is done here besides
the mere teaching; a great deal of correspondence
carried on; a great deal of
what may be called pastoral care exercised;
a good deal, also, of honest study
of God’s word.</p>

<p>But I am making my story too long.
About two miles south of this, on Ridley
Street, is the Barnes Mission house,
a substantial two-story structure of
wood, with a smaller building on the
rear of the lot, occupied by our Chinese
brethren as a “Home.” This is owned by
the Mission, but has a debt upon it of
$3,300. The upper story is occupied by
the family furnishing the teachers for
the school in the room below. The
mother and daughter, Mrs. C. A. Sheldon
and Miss Jennie Sheldon, are the
ones whose names appear upon our lists,
but father and brothers all share lovingly
and zealously in the work. The rent
derived from this upper story and from
the “Home” in the rear, pays the interest
on the debt, and the cost of insurance
and taxes. When we were
erecting this building, we expected to
gather in it a school of 150 members
with an average attendance of about 100;

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a>

but, the very evening of its dedication,
the riots of July 1877 occurred, and, for
the time, our work in almost all the city
seemed to be knocked prostrate. Other
changes, the closing of some large shoe
factories, from which many of our
pupils came, and the restrictions laid
upon the operatives in the Mission
Woolen Mills, among whom we hoped to
win some souls, have prevented the
realization of all that we hoped, though
the results at which all was aimed, have
not been denied. There are many of
whom&mdash;looking at our Barnes Mission
house&mdash;we may say, “This man was
born there.”</p>

<p>A mile and a half further south is the
Bethany school, taught in the chapel of
Bethany church, and through the faithfulness
and tact of its teacher well sustained,
although the Chinese are not
specially numerous in that locality.
And about two miles west of the Central
Mission is the “West” school,
taught in a little back-room, behind a
small store&mdash;a room most unpromising,
and rented for only $5 per month,
but, by the taste and care of teachers
and pupils, rendered quite neat and inviting.
The average attendance in each
of these schools is a little less than 20,
ranging between 12 and 19.</p>

<p>In the aggregate, about 175 Chinese
now belong to these four schools; not
as many by nearly one-half as were enrolled
in them three years ago. Sandlotism,
especially after it invaded our
pulpits, has been a sore hindrance to
missionary success. But we have tried
to get closer to those whom we could
bring within our reach, and to do better
work among them, and God has graciously
owned it in saving power. Sixty-six
have been received to Bethany
church, and of at least as many more
the hope is cherished that they have
passed from death unto life. The present
outlook seems to me to be especially
cheering, not only here but in almost
all our fields.</p>

<h3>THE ELEPHANT IN AFRICA.</h3>

<p class="p1">We have seen many pictures of elephants
in Africa, and they were all in
hunting scenes.</p>

<p>This noble, wise, and magnificent
animal is hunted in every part of Africa;
shot by the Englishman’s rifle in
South Africa and on the White Nile,
speared by the natives, pursued with
the sword by the Abyssinian tribes, as if
he were the most deadly enemy of the
human race.</p>

<p>It is all for ivory, for the tusks which
have taken perhaps fifty years to grow,
that the huge beast is slain.</p>

<p>This hunting has been going on for
many years, and now in parts of Africa
there are no more elephants left.</p>

<p>Some good people, who are also trying
to open up the “Dark Continent,”
resolved to try some Indian elephants.
They were sent from Bombay in a ship to
Zanzibar, and after much trouble were
landed on the coast. Then away they
marched, and after a little time this
new procession reached our station at
Mpwapwa, and our missionary, Mr.
Last, writes to say how successful the
elephants have been. The dreaded fly
could not harm them; indeed, they kill
the flies by catching them in the folds
of their thick skin, if the old African
travellers are to be believed.</p>

<p>Our missionary, Mr. Stokes, writes
from Uyuvi that these elephants had
reached Unyamwezi. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>“They can bear a thirty-six miles’
march without food or water. They
can carry from twenty-five to thirty
men’s loads; and the natives here very
soon pick up the management of them.

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a>

I think these elephants have done more
towards the civilization of Central
Africa than anything else I have seen.
The natives think the white man a most
wonderful fellow when these big creatures
on which they look with terror
obey him. It was quite a picture to
view the astonishment depicted on the
faces of these poor blacks, as they
watched these huge beasts kneeling down
at the word of command to let us get
on their backs, or elevating their trunks
to bid salaam to an Arab.”</p>

<p>The Church Missionary Society would
be very glad if it could send two or
three of these wise beasts to their
Mission at Mpwapwa, to help carry
the missionaries up and down with the
stores they must have from time to
time; and then, when our missionaries
can speak freely in the language, think
what a help the elephant would be on a
missionary tour.</p>

<p>Besides, when the natives see how
useful the elephants are, they will soon
learn to catch and tame them, as did the
Carthaginians, 600 years before Christ.</p>

<p>Turn to the fortieth chapter of Job,
and read about the behemoth. You
will see in the marginal reference,
“The Elephant.” “He is the chief of
the ways of God.” What a blessed
time that will be, if, instead of being
destroyed by man, this, the most wonderful
of God’s creatures, is used to
carry about the messengers of the Gospel
of Peace!&mdash;<cite>Church Missionary Juvenile

<span class="medium">INCORPORATED JANUARY 30, 1849.</span></h2>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p><span class="smcap">Art. I.</span> This Society shall be called
“<span class="smcap">The American Missionary Association</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span> The object of this Association
shall be to conduct Christian missionary and educational operations,
and diffuse a knowledge of the Holy Scriptures in our own and other
countries which are destitute of them, or which present open and urgent
fields of effort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. III.</span> Any person of evangelical
sentiments,<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a
href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> who professes faith in
the Lord Jesus Christ, who is not a slave-holder, or in the practice
of other immoralities, and who contributes to the funds, may become a
member of the Society; and by the payment of thirty dollars, a life
member; provided that children and others who have not professed
their faith may be constituted life members without the privilege of
voting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IV.</span> This Society shall meet
annually, in the month of September, October or November, for the
election of officers and the transaction of other business, at such
time and place as shall be designated by the Executive Committee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. V.</span> The annual meeting shall be
constituted of the regular officers and members of the Society at the
time of such meeting, and of delegates from churches, local missionary
societies, and other co-operating bodies, each body being entitled to
one representative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VI.</span> The officers of the Society
shall be a President, Vice-Presidents, a Recording Secretary,
Corresponding Secretaries, Treasurer, two Auditors, and an Executive
Committee of not less than twelve, of which the Corresponding
Secretaries shall be advisory, and the Treasurer ex-officio,
members.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span> To the Executive Committee
shall belong the collecting and disbursing of funds; the appointing,
counselling, sustaining and dismissing (for just and sufficient
reasons) missionaries and agents; the selection of missionary fields;
and, in general, the transaction of all such business as usually
appertains to the executive committees of missionary and other
benevolent societies; the Committee to exercise no ecclesiastical
jurisdiction over the missionaries; and its doings to be subject always
to the revision of the annual meeting, which shall, by a reference
mutually chosen, always entertain the complaints of any aggrieved agent
or missionary; and the decision of such reference shall be final.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee shall have authority to fill all vacancies
occurring among the officers between the regular annual meetings;
to apply, if they see fit, to any State Legislature for acts of
incorporation; to fix the compensation, where any is given, of all
officers, agents, missionaries, or others in the employment of the
Society; to make provision, if any, for disabled missionaries, and
for the widows and children of such as are deceased; and to call, in
all parts of the country, at their discretion, special and general
conventions of the friends of missions, with a view to the diffusion of
the missionary spirit, and the general and vigorous promotion of the
missionary work.</p>

<p>Five members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for
transacting business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VIII.</span> This society, in collecting
funds, in appointing officers, agents and missionaries, and in
selecting fields of labor, and conducting the missionary work, will
endeavor particularly to discountenance slavery, by refusing to receive
the known fruits of unrequited labor, or to welcome to its employment
those who hold their fellow-beings as slaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IX.</span> Missionary bodies, churches or
individuals agreeing to the principles of this Society, and wishing to
appoint and sustain missionaries of their own, shall be entitled to do
so through the agency of the Executive Committee, on terms mutually
agreed upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. X.</span> No amendment shall be made to
this Constitution without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members
present at a regular annual meeting; nor unless the proposed amendment
has been submitted to a previous meeting, or to the Executive Committee
in season to be published by them (as it shall be their duty to do, if
so submitted) in the regular official notifications of the meeting.</p>

By evangelical sentiments, we understand, among others, a belief
in the guilty and lost condition of all men without a Saviour; the
Supreme Deity, Incarnation and Atoning Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the
only Saviour of the world; the necessity of regeneration by the Holy
Spirit, repentance, faith and holy obedience in order to salvation; the
immortality of the soul; and the retributions of the judgment in the
eternal punishment of the wicked, and salvation of the righteous.

<h3><span class="xlarge">The American Missionary Association.</span></h3>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="article">
<h4>AIM AND WORK.</h4>

<p class="p1">To preach the Gospel to the poor. It originated in
a sympathy with the almost friendless slaves. Since Emancipation
it has devoted its main efforts to preparing the <span
class="smcap">Freedmen</span> for their duties as citizens and
Christians in America and as missionaries in Africa. As closely
related to this, it seeks to benefit the caste-persecuted <span
class="smcap">Chinese</span> in America, and to co-operate with
the Government in its humane and Christian policy towards the
<span class="smcap">Indians</span>. It has also a mission in <span
class="smcap">Africa</span>.</p>

<h4>STATISTICS.</h4>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Churches</span>: <i>In the
South</i>&mdash;In Va.,1; N. C., 5; S. C., 2; Ga., 13; Ky., 7; Tenn., 4;
Ala., 14; La., 12; Miss., 1; Kansas, 2; Texas, 6. <i>Africa</i>, 2. <i>Among

taught by former pupils of our schools, estimated at 150,000. <span
class="smcap">Indians</span> under the care of the Association,
13,000.</p>

<h4>WANTS.</h4>

<p class="p1">1. A steady <span class="medium">INCREASE</span> of
regular income to keep pace with the growing work. This increase can
only be reached by <em>regular</em> and <em>larger</em> contributions from the
churches&mdash;the feeble as well as the strong.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Additional Buildings</span> for our higher
educational institutions, to accommodate the increasing numbers of
students; <span class="smcap">Meeting Houses</span> for the new
churches we are organizing; <span class="smcap">More Ministers</span>,
cultured and pious, for these churches.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Help for Young Men</span>, to be educated as
ministers here and missionaries to Africa&mdash;a pressing want.</p>

<p>Before sending boxes, always correspond with the nearest A. M. A.
office, as below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span class="smcap">New York</span>     H. W. Hubbard, Esq., 56 Reade Street.<br />
<span class="smcap">Boston</span>       Rev. C. L. Woodworth, Room 21 Congregational House.<br />
<span class="smcap">Chicago</span>      Rev. Jas. Powell, 112 West Washington Street.<br />

</blockquote>

<h4>MAGAZINE.</h4>

<p class="p1">This Magazine will be sent, gratuitously, if desired, to
the Missionaries of the Association; to Life Members; to all clergymen
who take up collections for the Association; to Superintendents of
Sabbath Schools; to College Libraries; to Theological Seminaries; to
Societies of Inquiry on Missions; and to every donor who does not
prefer to take it as a subscriber, and contributes in a year not less
than five dollars.</p>

<p>Those who wish to remember the <span class="smcap">American
Missionary Association</span> in their last Will and Testament, are
earnestly requested to use the following</p>

<h4>FORM OF A BEQUEST.</h4>

<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">I bequeath</span> to my executor
(or executors) the sum of &mdash;&mdash; dollars in trust, to pay the
same in &mdash;&mdash; days after my decease to the person who, when
the same is payable, shall act as Treasurer of the ‘American Missionary
Association’ of New York City, to be applied, under the direction of
the Executive Committee of the Association, to its charitable uses and
purposes.”</p>

<p>The will should be attested by three witnesses [in some States three
are required&mdash;in other States only two], who should write against
their names, their places of residence [if in cities, their street and
number]. The following form of attestation will answer for every State
in the Union: “Signed, sealed, published and declared by the said [A.
B.] as his last Will and Testament, in presence of us, who, at the
request of the said A. B., and in his presence, and in the presence of
each other, have hereunto subscribed our names as witnesses.” In some
States it is required that the Will should be made at least two months
before the death of the testator.</p>

<p class="p1">We have been gratified with the constant tokens of the increasing appreciation of
the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> during the past year, and purpose to spare no effort to make its pages
of still greater value to those interested in the work which it records.</p>

<p>Shall we not have a largely increased subscription list for 1880?</p>

<p>A little effort on the part of our friends, when making their own remittances, to
induce their neighbors to unite in forming Clubs, will easily double our list, and thus
widen the influence of our Magazine, and aid in the enlargement of our work.</p>

<p>Under the editorial supervision of Rev. <span class="medium">C. C. PAINTER</span>, aided by the steady
contributions of our intelligent Missionaries and teachers in all parts of the field, and
with occasional communications from careful observers and thinkers elsewhere, the
<span class="smcap">American Missionary</span> furnishes a vivid and reliable picture of the work going forward
among the Indians, the Chinamen on the Pacific Coast, and the Freedmen as
citizens in the South and as Missionaries in Africa.</p>

<p>It will be the vehicle of important views on all matters affecting the races among
which it labors, and will give a monthly summary of current events relating to their
welfare and progress.</p>

<p>Patriots and Christians interested in the education and Christianizing of these
despised races are asked to read it, and assist in its circulation. Begin with the next
number and the new year. The price is only Fifty Cents per annum.</p>

<p>The Magazine will be sent gratuitously, if preferred, to the persons indicated on
page 223.</p>

<p>Donations and subscriptions should be sent to</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
